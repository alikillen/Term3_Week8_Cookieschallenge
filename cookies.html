<!-- Client-side cookies
This challenge may behave weirdly within Ed - it may be best to work from a local file & use Live Server to preview your solution!

The code provided is a really basic rip-off of the gaming classic, "Cookie Clicker".

Press the button & the number goes up.

When you refresh the page, the number resets. That's bad. 

Fill out the saveCountToCookie and readCountFromCookie functions so that they allow this page to continue its count - the count should never be zero once the button has been clicked at least once!


Note: No other code in the sample needs to be edited to solve this challenge.

Any edits you do outside of the two specified functions are entirely up to you, but are not required to solve the challenge at all.

This means you do NOT need ExpressJS at all here -- you're using local browser JS to solve this challenge!


This may need a bit of reading on w3schools and/or MDN docs. -->
